# Autism-Screening-System-0
This is the 1st python code for child detection in Autism Screening System  
The ".ipynb" file is just for test and I will upload the completed one soon ...

# How it Works?!
We start from describing section 12 of code! Because before that section, we have written the functions that we are going to use in main loop and we will describe them in another part.  
  
Lines 2 and 3: These two lines create a csv file which we are going to use in saving positions of  
Lines 6 and 7: These two lines are setuping our saved output video  
Line 10: This line reads the input video  
Line 13: This line is just reading the first frame to define child's first position in base on that in next step  
Lines 16, ..., 19: These 4 lines define frist position of child by asking it from user
