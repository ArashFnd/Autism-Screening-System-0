# Autism-Screening-System-0
This is the 1st python code for child detection in Autism Screening System
The ".ipynb" file is just for test and I will upload the completed one soon ...

# How it Works?!
We start from describing section 12 of code! Because before that section, we have written the functions that we are going to use in main loop.
Lines 2 and 3: These two lines create a csv file which we are going to use in saving positions of child.
Lines 6 and 7: These two lines are setuping our saved output video
Line 10: This line reads the input video
Line 13: This line is just reading the first frame to define child's first position in base on that in next step
Lines 16, ..., 19: These 4 lines define frist position of child by asking it from user
